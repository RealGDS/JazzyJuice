      <div id="lyrics-content">
        <p>I went down to the local McDonald's</p>
        <p>But they didn't have any Jazzy Juice</p>
        <p>I sat down crying, with my dog</p>
        <p>But we continued on</p>
        <p>I ran 50 miles</p>
        <p>They all told me, you'll never find it</p>
        <p>The only thing you'll find is a knuckle sandwich</p>
        <p>So I asked my friends, and I asked my wall</p>
        <p>Where is Jazzy Juice</p>
        <p>I turned around and saw it with my eyes</p>
        <p>And I ran faster than the sky</p>
        <p>I was almost in reach, of the juice</p>
        <p>But then my shoes were loose</p>
        <p>I had to tie them</p>
        <p>I looked up to see the juice being taken</p>
        <p>I caught up and caked him sending Jazzy Juice to the sky</p>
        <p>I planted my shoes down</p>
        <p>It's heading towards the ground</p>
        <p>And I caught Jazzy Juice</p>
        <p>But something started coursing through my veins</p>
        <p>My juice fell down and I didn't feel the same</p>
        <p>Moon fries looking kinda different what changed</p>
        <p>This song is going crazy it's about to go insane</p>
        <p>My brother lost a game of Fortnite and he let loose</p>
        <p>He got so mad he broke his legs and couldn't move</p>
        <p>Now all he wanted was good old Dr. Seuss</p>
        <p>But hey what's it matter we got Jazzy Juice</p>
        <p>I danced for hours with my drink, all damn day</p>
        <p>Bustin moves all the way</p>
        <p>I could not care less, about you</p>
